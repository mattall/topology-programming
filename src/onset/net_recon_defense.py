"""
Network obfuscation algorithm.
Author: Matt Nance-Hall

Context:
    -A network's base topology, G, is a collections Nodes and Links.
    -The routing topology is the set of paths for network flows on G.
    -The rank of a link, r_l, is the proportion of network flows that traverse it.
    -We can transform the base topology from G to G' with optical circuit switching.
    -The operation also changes the  r_l for all links.

Threat:
    -An adversary that maps the network's routing topology can target critical links 
    with high volume flows and disrupt connectivity for benign users.

Goal:
    -Increase difficulty of mapping the routing topology for an adversary.

Method:
    -At random points in time change the base topology with random addition or removal of 
    links such that utility of the network is not affect for benign users.

Detail:
    -Initialize the Reconfigurable Link Set as an empty set which will later contain node pairs.
    -Calculate link rank, r_l, for all links in the base topology.
    -Choose a random cutoff and add all links with r_l greater than the cutoff to the Reconfigurable Link Set.
    -Add pairs of nodes who are adjacent to links in the Reconfigurable Link Set to the set too.
    -At a random point in time, generate a "proposed update" by choosing a random subset form the Reconfigurable Link Set.
    -Simulate current traffic with the "proposed update" and if traffic performance is acceptable, push the change by 
    adding/removing links from the chosen subset---The updated graph is G'.
    -If performance drops in the simulation choose a new subset for the "proposed update".

Evaluation:
    -Show that graphs G and G' are not homomorphic.
    -Show that flow density of nodes and links in G and G' are significantly different

    Possible tests for similarity of the distributions
        - Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
        - Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test
        - Cramér–von Mises test

   Show the time required to find G'.
